# Indian Cities AQI Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository contains the complete work for the **Indian Cities AQI Analysis** project, focusing on understanding air quality patterns across major Indian cities using AQI and related environmental indicators. The objective is to clean and prepare the data, perform exploratory analysis and clustering, and build interactive BI dashboards to support data-driven decisions on air quality management.

## Objectives
- Clean and preprocess AQI data for Indian cities.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand distributions and trends.
- Apply clustering techniques to segment cities based on AQI and related features.
- Visualize results through interactive Power BI dashboards.
- Document methodology, results, and managerial insights in a structured report and presentation.

## Repository Structure
- `BIDM_Dataset.csv` / `BIDM_Dataset.xlsx`  
  Raw/primary dataset used for analysis.
- `Clustering_Results.xlsx`  
  Outputs from clustering models, including cluster labels and summary statistics.
- `Codes/`  
  Jupyter Notebooks and scripts for data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, and clustering.
- `Power BI Files/`  
  Power BI `.pbix` files containing dashboards and visual analyses.
- `Extracted Files (Not for Use)/`  
  Intermediate or helper files not used in the final analysis.
- `Others/`  
  Supporting or miscellaneous project-related files.
- `Group6_BIDM_Project_Report.docx` / `Group6_BIDM_Project_Report.pdf`  
  Detailed project report covering problem statement, methodology, results, and conclusions.
- `BIDM_Group06.pptx`  
  Presentation summarizing key insights and visualizations from the project.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming & Analysis:** Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Business Intelligence:** Microsoft Power BI
- **Data Formats:** CSV, Excel, PowerPoint, PDF

## How to Use
1. Explore the dataset (`BIDM_Dataset.*`) to understand the raw AQI-related data.
2. Open the notebooks in `Codes/` to follow the end-to-end workflow:
   - Data cleaning and preprocessing
   - Exploratory data analysis
   - Clustering and result generation
3. Review `Clustering_Results.xlsx` for final cluster assignments and summary outputs.
4. Open the `.pbix` files in `Power BI Files/` to interact with the dashboards.
5. Refer to the report and presentation files for a concise narrative of the project.
